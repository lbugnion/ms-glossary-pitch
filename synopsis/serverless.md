> ~ 15 seconds intro

Hello and welcome to Microsoft Azure Words of the Day,
the show that teaches you the Azure vocabulary!
Today's word is: Serverless

> ~ 55 seconds on camera

Serverless means that your application runs on a server, but you don't have to worry about that server. It is abstracted. On Microsoft, there are a few solutions you can use to run code in a serverless manner, for example Azure Functions, or Logic Apps.

> Portal triggers

In an Azure Function, you can start the execution of your code by observing some triggers. There are a number of trigger types, for example HTTP triggers to respond to an HTTP request; timer trigger to execute code on a schedule; event grid triggers to answer to events happening in another Azure service; Cosmos DB trigger to execute code when something changes in a database; and many more.

> Documentation bindings

Azure Functions also have bindings, which allow them to input and output values from and to different sources. Don't forget to check the documentation here to get more information about that!

> logic app designer then cut to connectors

A Logic App also starts its execution when an event happens. There are many sources of events, for example when you receive an email in Outlook or Gmail, when a document is modified in Office 365, and many many many more.

> Demo scale up

One really nice feature of serverless is that your application will automatically scale up and down. Here we see how an Azure Function application is automatically scaling up to additional servers when a lot of requests arrive. This way you are covered, if a lot of people like your product, we will provide additional servers to cover the demand. And since you only pay for what you actually consume, serverless solutions end up being quite cost effective.
